## Just Have AI Do It
That's what one of my friends said to me while I was making edits to my one of my websites. I honestly thought about it for a second and then decided not to and my reasoning was this: 

**Why can't I just do it myself?** 

It's late in the evening, I already had dinner, and I'm not doing anything important at the moment. I have my music playing in the background, there's a cup of coffee right here that I'm drinking (bad idead at night), and there are no pressing matters happening right now. 

*"Have AI do all the tedious stuff so that you can focus on what's important."* 

There is nothing important happening right now. If there was I wouldn't be on the computer making edits to my website. I can't think of every moment of my time as being an opportunity for me to be productive. I don't want to be productive all the time. I don't want to feel like I need to be cranking out the next big thing and having AI assist me in making it happen fast. I'm just trying to enjoy myself and enjoy the process of programming. 

I think there is a lot of missed learning opportunities when you can tell AI what you want and it produces what appears to be a working project. That's great and I think that it is fantastic that AI has gotten to the point where it can be mostly right straight away, but I like to know why something in my project is not working or what I did to make it behave in ways I wasn't expecting. I enjoy going through the process of learning these things and sometimes you miss out on that when you blindly have AI do it all. 

I strongly support AI as a tool for people in STEM and for learning. Sometimes when I'm working through a problem with AI and it tells me that I almost had it, but you made this mistake it's like a little dopamine hit. "Ah dang, so close." but then I learn to do it the correct way from that point on. It's like having another set of eyes when you are working alone or pair programming as we call it.

I'm lucky enough to have a job right now so I don't feel the need to be maxing out my use of AI so that I can get in with some company. I know that is not the case  for everyone though. Just a bit of a tangent I suppose and a idea I had in my head so decided to try to add it to my blog. I hope that you have a good day and a great rest of your year.
