      <div class="about-me__body">
        <p>Hello! My name is Michael and I am currently a full-time undergrad at
          Humboldt State University, majoring in Computer Science.</p>
          <br>
        <p>
          I have worked on
          class projects focusing on C++, Python, Data Structures, Database Design
          as well as having some personal projects outside of class that have allowed
          me to gain a deeper understanding of what I've been learning, most of which
          can be viewed on the work page.

          <h3>Gambala</h3>
            <p>This is an attempt at making a text (console) based casino game using C++.
              It currently functions as intended and has two games available,
              dice roll game and blackjack. This was a project I worked on over
              the summer to put some of what I had learned that spring semester
              into something enjoyable and fun. As I take more classes I hope that
              I can improve on this and add more futures and functionality, as well
              as better structure and in overall enjoyment.

          <h3>Twitter Bot</h3>
            <p>This was a bot that I had worked on in my CS 232 Python Programming
              class in spring 20221. What it does is when run it will randomly
              retweet a post from a user, from a specified list that I have
              created, as well as respond to tweets that have keywords relating
              to games and it will respond with that games twitter page.

          <h3>Space Invaders Clone</h3>
            <p>This is my version of the space invaders clone that we made for
              CS 232 Pythong Programming. For this assingment I learned to work
              with pygame to create a window and screen, which I populated with
              images and created the logic for how the invaders should behave at
              certain points. My version included a boss that did not go to lower
              levels, but was to be protected by the other invaders as his health
              became lower.
