          <h3>Games</h3>
          <p>Games, both video and other forms, have always been a big aspect
            of my life and I still carry that with me in some form. I greatly enjoy
            doing work related to these things as well as coming up with ideas
            about how I can create my own or improve some games. There was a
            time where I enjoyed streaming them on Twitch, but that is usually
            few and far inbetween.

          <p>
            Currently I am working at my University while getting my degree, but
            while this is going on I continue to work on side projects to further
            develop what I am learning in class any given semester.

            I tend to make youtube videos every now and then just for fun
            and maybe as a way of helping some of the people who might
            be looking for some information regarding certain coding help.

        <p>Hello! My name is Michael and I am currently a full-time undergrad at

        <p>
          I have worked on
          class projects focusing on C++, Python, Data Structures, Database Design
          as well as having some personal projects outside of class that have allowed
          me to gain a deeper understanding of what I've been learning, most of which
          can be viewed on the work page.

          <h3>Gambala</h3>
            <p>This is an attempt at making a text (console) based casino game using C++.
              It currently functions as intended and has two games available,
              dice roll game and blackjack. This was a project I worked on over
              the summer to put some of what I had learned that spring semester
              into something enjoyable and fun. As I take more classes I hope that
              I can improve on this and add more futures and functionality, as well
              as better structure and in overall enjoyment.

            <p>This was a bot that I had worked on in my CS 232 Python Programming
              class in spring 20221. What it does is when run it will randomly
              retweet a post from a user, from a specified list that I have
              created, as well as respond to tweets that have keywords relating
              to games and it will respond with that games twitter page.

          <h3>Space Invaders Clone</h3>
            <p>This is my version of the space invaders clone that we made for
              CS 232 Pythong Programming. For this assingment I learned to work
              with pygame to create a window and screen, which I populated with
              images and created the logic for how the invaders should behave at
              certain points. My version included a boss that did not go to lower
              levels, but was to be protected by the other invaders as his health
              became lower.
